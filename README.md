# Seminar
**Use of Artificial Intelligence and Automation for Medicine and Healthcare.**<br />
##Abstract and keywords<br />
###Abstract:<br />
Medicine is a field that is starting to gravitate towards the temptation to incorporate
automation and artificial intelligence into medical practices. Recent developments in deep
learning has increased the confidence of researchers in AI models to give better results. There are
many use-cases of AI application in medical diagnosis today, e.g. pneumonia diagnosis through
deep learning, symptoms analysis and diagnosis. AI models can be used to provide a diagnosis
from remote places using just medical equipment and suitable technology.
AI technologies can be used to provide a better diagnosis of diseases in remote areas
present with a lack of medical experts and accessibility to better healthcare. This seminar report
will discuss the current state of AI and automation in Medicine and healthcare and it’s future.
It’ll also discuss technologies that make this artificial intelligence-based medical diagnosis
possible.<br />
